- [x] 1) Create a new repo named week4
- [ ] 2) Invite hbull5 as a collaborator for this repo
- [x] 3) Create two files index.html & app1.js
- [x] 4) Our index.html should have the boilerplate and a single with the content of "Check the console..."
- [x] 5) Make sure to link your index.html to app1.js, from now on out we will be working out of app1.js file.
- [x] 6) Write a message to the console that says "Hello world!"
- [x] 7) Write a warning to the console that says "This is a warning!"
- [x] 8) Write an error to the console that says "Error! System critical!"
- [x] 9) Declare a variable named var1
- [x] 10) Assign a string data type value to var1
- [x] 11) Write the value of var1 to the console
- [x] ] 12) Write a blank line to the console. (I showed one way to do this in class, there are some others feel free to use those instead if you'd like, practice your google-fu)
- [x] 13) Define and assign a variable named var2, the value should be of the number type
- [x] 14) Evaluate var1 + var2 and write the result to the console (You can store the result in a variable and write it to the console, or pass the expression into a method that will remain un-named)
- [x] 15) Could you guess the result? Write your guess in an inline comment next to where you're writing it to the console
- [ ] 16) Add in a multi line comment and write some of the types we covered in class today on individual lines
- [x] 17) Write the type of the var1 variable to the console
- [x] 18) Can you guess the result? Write your guess in an inline comment next to where you're writing to the console.
- [x] 19) Declare a variable named var3 and assign it the string value text
- [x] 20) Write the value of var3 to the console
- [x] 21)  Reassign var3 to a boolean value
- [x] 21)  Write the value of var3 to the console
- [x] 22)  Reassign var1 to the number 5
- [x] 23)  Reassign var2 to the string 5
- [ ] 24)  In any order or in however many lines you'd like, parse var2 from a string to a number and add it to var1, write your result to the console.
